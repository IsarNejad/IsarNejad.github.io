I am a Senior Research Scientist at the [National Research Council Canada](https://nrc.canada.ca/en) and an Adjunct Professor at the [University of Ottawa](https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-engineering/school-electrical-engineering-computer-science). In my [research](https://isarnejad.github.io//research/), I am interested in applying machine learning models to make positive changes in society. I also work on making sure that AI systems are designed and used responsibly. Previously, I have worked on building and deploying machine learning systems in a variety of applications, including biomedical signal, image, speech and text processing, in both academic and industrial environments. My current work is mostly focused on Natural Language Processing, and in a few projects I work on multimodal systems that combine images and text.
