I am a Senior Research Scientist at the [National Research Council Canada](https://nrc.canada.ca/en) and an Adjunct Professor at the [University of Ottawa](https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-engineering/school-electrical-engineering-computer-science). In my [research](https://isarnejad.github.io//research/), I am interested in applying machine learning models to make positive changes in society. I also work on making sure that AI systems are designed and used responsibly. Previously, I have worked on building and deploying machine learning systems in various applications, including biomedical signal, image, speech and text processing, in both academic and industrial environments. My current work is mainly on natural language processing, and in a few projects, I work on multimodal systems that combine images and text. I serve as a reviewer at ACL conferences and was an area chair at ACL2023 and EMNLP2023. I am also a committee member at Several ACL workshops, including WOAH, TrustNLP and PrivateNLP. Outside work, I practice Persian choir singing with [Bahar Choir Group](https://m.facebook.com/100057890747251/videos/arash-fouladvand-academy/668851780472720/?locale=fo_FO&_rdr).

### I will be at the [Pathway to Prosperity national conference](https://site.pheedloop.com/event/p2pvvp2023/home) in Montreal, organizing a workshop. 

**Title of workshop:** Responsible AI in Settlement Services: Challenges, Social Context, and Ethical AI Solutions 

**Description of workshop:** In this workshop, we hope to explore opportunities and limitations of AI language technologies in the immigration context. We first explore the current landscape of settlement services that can be facilitated, assessed, or audited by language technologies. Then, we delve into assessing the potential for a responsible adoption of these technologies in the Canadian settlement service sectors. Some examples encompass translation services, structuring data, detecting patterns on an unparalleled scale, automatic reporting, and auditing fairness in decision-making processes. We conclude by discussing the risks and challenges of deploying these technologies, emphasizing the importance of fostering fair and inclusive technologies.

**workshop chair:**

Anna Jahn, Director of Public Policy and Learning, MILA - Quebec Artificial Intelligence
