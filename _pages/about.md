Title: Natural Language Explanations in the XAI Landscape
 
Abstract: In this talk, I first quickly reviewed the main concepts of Explainable AI (XAI) and then focused on natural language explanations. With the rapid advancements in development and adoption of large language models, it is now possible to generate verbalized explanations across different aspects of AI-based decision-making tailored for various goals and audiences. However, research shows that, if not designed thoughtfully, such explanations might be ineffective or even misleading. I explored the critical components of effective explainer modules, discussed the essential characteristics they should embody, and highlighted key evaluation criteria to ensure their reliability and impact.

### September 2024 - I was invited to the "Peel-Halton Professional Development and AI webinar Series for Newcomer-Serving Staff and Partner Organizations" to talk about the ‚ÄúRole and Implications of Generative AI and Larger Language Models in Supporting Newcomers.‚Äù 

More than 150 people attended this webinar, and we had a very interesting Q&A session at the end. [Link to the webinar](https://km4s.ca/2024/09/role-of-generative-ai-in-supporting-newcomers-webinar-recording/)


**Abstract:** A successful settlement requires access to accurate information at the right time and a reasonable cost. To enhance the efficiency of information delivery, the settlement sector can significantly benefit from AI-enabled tools. However, while AI research has previously focused on screening and selection processes in immigration, the potential applications of AI in the settlement sector remain understudied. In this talk, I will first explore various applications of AI-enabled language technologies that could be developed for the settlement sector and integrated into its existing service structures. Then, given the foundational role of large language models (LLMs) in developing language technologies, I will caution against the ad-hoc use of general-purpose LLMs and present examples of biases, hallucinations, and functional disparities that could negatively impact newcomers. The talk will conclude with recommendations for creating LLM-based tools specifically designed for the settlement sector and ensuring they are empowering, inclusive, and safe.

### June 2024 - We organized a tutorial on [Risks of General-Purpose LLMs for Settling Newcomers in Canada](https://facctconference.org/2024/acceptedtutorials) at the ACM Fairness, Accountability and Transparency (FAccT) 2024 conference. [Read the Report](https://isarnejad.github.io/files/AI-in-Settlement.pdf){:target="_blank"}

I co-organized this tutorial with [Maryam Molamohammadi](https://mila.quebec/fr/maryam-molamohammadi) and [Samir Bakhtawar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samirbakht/?originalSubdomain=ca). Our intern, [Kosar Hemmati](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kosar-hemmati/?originalSubdomain=ca), has also put enormous efforts into supporting us for this tutorial. 

**Abstract:** The non-profit settlement sector in Canada supports newcomers in achieving successful integration. This sector faces increasing operational pressures amidst rising immigration targets, which highlights a need for enhanced efficiency and innovation, potentially through reliable AI solutions. The ad-hoc use of general-purpose generative AI, such as ChatGPT, might become a common practice among newcomers and service providers to address this need. However, these tools are not tailored for the settlement domain and can have detrimental implications for immigrants and refugees. We explore the risks that these tools might pose on newcomers to first, warn against the unguarded use of generative AI, and second, to incentivize further research and development in creating AI literacy programs as well as customized LLMs that are aligned with the preferences of the impacted communities. Crucially, such technologies should be designed to integrate seamlessly into the existing workflow of the settlement sector, ensuring human oversight, trustworthiness, and accountability.

### February 2024  - I was an invited participant of [Frontiers of Science: Artificial Intelligence](https://rsc-src.ca/en/events/frontiers-science-2024) held in the gorgeous Chateau Laurier in Ottawa. 

The Royal Society of Canada organized this event, and it was a fantastic multidisciplinary meeting focused on early- to mid-career researchers of artificial intelligence. The meeting brought together 20 researchers from Canada and 20 from the UK, with diverse backgrounds in computer science, history, communication, ethics and policy making. The flexible structure of the meeting gave us the opportunity to listen to eye-opening talks from pioneer thinkers of the field and the chance to discuss these ideas in the context of our work in group discussions. For me, the main takeaway was that we will not succeed in achieving much-needed regulations and safeguards around AI unless we break the vicious cycle of fast and profit-oriented science. A safe and reliable AI that benefits all is hard to achieve but worth the fight.

### November 2023 - I co-organized a workshop at the [Pathway to Prosperity national conference](https://site.pheedloop.com/event/p2pvvp2023/home) in Montreal. 

**Title of workshop:** Responsible AI in Settlement Services: Challenges, Social Context, and Ethical AI Solutions 

**Description of workshop:** In this workshop, we explored the potential and limitations of AI language technologies in the immigration context. We first explore the current landscape of settlement services that can be facilitated, assessed, or audited by language technologies. Then, we delve into assessing the potential for a responsible adoption of these technologies in the Canadian settlement service sectors. Some examples encompass translation services, structuring data, detecting patterns on an unparalleled scale, automatic reporting, and auditing fairness in decision-making processes. We conclude by discussing the risks and challenges of deploying these technologies, emphasizing the importance of fostering fair and inclusive technologies.
