I am a Senior Research Scientist at the [National Research Council Canada](https://nrc.canada.ca/en) and an Adjunct Professor at the [University of Ottawa](https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-engineering/school-electrical-engineering-computer-science). In my [research](https://isarnejad.github.io//research/), I am interested in applying machine learning models to make positive changes in society. I also work on making sure that AI systems are designed and used responsibly. Previously, I have worked on building and deploying machine learning systems in various applications, including biomedical signal, image, speech and text processing, in both academic and industrial environments. My current work is mainly on natural language processing, and in a few projects, I work on multimodal systems that combine images and text. I serve as a reviewer at ACL conferences and was an area chair at ACL2023 and EMNLP2023. I am also a committee member at Several ACL workshops, including WOAH, TrustNLP and PrivateNLP. Outside work, I practice Persian choir singing with [Bahar Choir Group](https://m.facebook.com/100057890747251/videos/arash-fouladvand-academy/668851780472720/?locale=fo_FO&_rdr).
