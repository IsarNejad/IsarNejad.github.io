I am a Senior Research Scientist at the [National Research Council Canada](https://nrc.canada.ca/en) and an Adjunct Professor at the [University of Ottawa](https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-engineering/school-electrical-engineering-computer-science). In my [research](https://isarnejad.github.io//research/), I am interested in leveraging machine learning models to address societal challenges, such as improving disaster response mechanisms, enhancing information delivery for settlement processes, and addressing harmful language on digital platforms. ⁤⁤I am also dedicated to incorporating the principles of responsible AI into digital solutions,  to ensure ethical considerations are integrated into technological advancements. Previously, I have worked on building and deploying machine learning systems in various applications, including biomedical signal, image, speech and text processing, in both academic and industrial environments. My current work is mainly on natural language processing, and in a few projects, I work on multimodal systems that combine images and text. I serve as a reviewer at ACL conferences and was an area chair at ACL2023, EMNLP2023, and EACL2023, and I am a committee member at Several ACL workshops, including WOAH, TrustNLP and PrivateNLP. Outside work, I practice Persian choir singing with [Bahar Choir Group](https://m.facebook.com/100057890747251/videos/arash-fouladvand-academy/668851780472720/?locale=fo_FO&_rdr).

### June 2024  - I will be leading a tutorial on [Risks of General-Purpose LLMs for Settling Newcomers in Canada](https://facctconference.org/2024/acceptedtutorials) in ACM Fairness, Accountability and Transparency (FAccT) 2024 conference. 

I have the pleasure of co-organizing this tutorial with [Maryam Molamohammadi](https://mila.quebec/fr/maryam-molamohammadi) and [Samir Bakhtawar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samirbakht/?originalSubdomain=ca). Our new intern, [Kosar Hemmati](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kosar-hemmati/?originalSubdomain=ca), has also put enormous effort into supporting us for this tutorial.  

**Abstract:** While AI has been frequently applied in the context of immigration, most of these applications primarily focus on selection and screening processes, which have raised concerns due to their understudied reliability and high impact on people's quality of life. In this tutorial, we focus on Canada’s immigration settlement phase, highlighting that this stage of immigration is information-heavy, and its service providers are overburdened. With concrete examples, we highlight how new immigrants and refugees might become overly dependent on and vulnerable to the extensive use of generic chatbots such as ChatGPT and raise awareness about the challenges and implications of over-reliance on such technologies. Based on the demonstrated evidence, we suggest that the settlement sector is a prime candidate for the adoption of human-centred AI applications, yet it remains under-explored in AI research. The tutorial provides recommendations and guidelines for further research on the development of AI literacy programs and the participatory design of AI tools for the newcomer community in Canada.

### February 2024  - I was an invited participant of [Frontiers of Science: Artificial Intelligence](https://rsc-src.ca/en/events/frontiers-science-2024) held in the gorgeous Chateau Laurier in Ottawa. 

The Royal Society of Canada organized this event, and it was a fantastic multidisciplinary meeting focused on early- to mid-career researchers of artificial intelligence. The meeting brought together 20 researchers from Canada and 20 from the UK, with diverse backgrounds in computer science, history, communication, ethics and policy making. The flexible structure of the meeting gave us the opportunity to listen to eye-opening talks from pioneer thinkers of the field and the chance to discuss these ideas in the context of our work in group discussions. For me, the main takeaway was that we will not succeed in achieving much-needed regulations and safeguards around AI unless we break the vicious cycle of fast and profit-oriented science. A safe and reliable AI that benefits all is hard to achieve but worth the fight.

### November 2023 - I co-organized a workshop at the [Pathway to Prosperity national conference](https://site.pheedloop.com/event/p2pvvp2023/home) in Montreal. 

**Title of workshop:** Responsible AI in Settlement Services: Challenges, Social Context, and Ethical AI Solutions 

**Description of workshop:** In this workshop, we explored the potential and limitations of AI language technologies in the immigration context. We first explore the current landscape of settlement services that can be facilitated, assessed, or audited by language technologies. Then, we delve into assessing the potential for a responsible adoption of these technologies in the Canadian settlement service sectors. Some examples encompass translation services, structuring data, detecting patterns on an unparalleled scale, automatic reporting, and auditing fairness in decision-making processes. We conclude by discussing the risks and challenges of deploying these technologies, emphasizing the importance of fostering fair and inclusive technologies.

**Workshop chair:**

Anna Jahn, Director of Public Policy and Learning, MILA - Quebec Artificial Intelligence 


**Speakers:**

Isar Nejadgholi, Senior Research Scientist, National Research Council Canada
*Presentation title:* Promises of Language Technologies for Digital Transformation of the Immigration and Settlement Sector

Maryam Mollamohammadi, Responsible AI Advisor, MILA - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute
*Presentation title:* Inclusive and Fair Digital Transformation: Responsible Use of Language Technologies in the Immigration Sector
