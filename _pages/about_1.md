## Isar Nejadgholi
I am a Senior Research Scientist at the National Research Council Canada and an Adjunct Professor at the University of Ottawa. My research focuses on applications of deep learning models to NLP tasks, mainly medical and social media text analysis. I am also interested in explaining black box models to uncover and mitigate potential societal harms including biases. Previously, I have worked on building and deploying machine learning systems in a variety of applications, including biomedical signal, image, speech and text processing, in both academic and industrial environments.
